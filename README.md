## Amethyst-Releases
This repository holds the published releases of Amethyst

### Deployment requirements:
- Install [VCRedist 2022](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- Install the [Windows App SDK](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.0-stable/msix-installer)

### Setup for testing:
- Delete **everything** in `C:/K2EX` (or wherever is it installed)
- Put Release zip in `C:/K2EX` (or wherever is it installed)
- Just extract the zip there. __File tree has to remain the same as before__

### Reports: 
- __This is still very WIP__, things will be broken and fixed on daily basis.
- Go to discord and post log files from ```%AppData%/KinectToVR/logs```

### Source:
In the current app's state, I've decided to hide the source until the app comes finished.<br>
If you really want it for some reason though, please write to us on the KinectToVR discord.
